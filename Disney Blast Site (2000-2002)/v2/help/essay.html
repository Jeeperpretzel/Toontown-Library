      <p align="CENTER"><b>Donald F. Roberts</b></p>
      <p align="CENTER"><b>Stanford University</b></p>
      <p><b>Children and the Internet</b>. As we begin the new millenium, almost
        half of U.S. households with children have a computer with an Internet
        connection (approximately 20% more had computers without Internet capabilities).
        A national survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 1999 found
        that 26% of all 2- through 7-year-olds and 48% of all 8- through 13-year-olds
        reported using a computer &quot;the previous day. &quot; That proportion
        continues to rise as the Internet makes its way into more and more homes.
        Even youngsters who do not have a computer at home surf the Web at schools,
        libraries, and friends’ houses. Youngsters who have easy access to computers
        tend to use them a great deal. Among kids reporting using a computer the
        previous day, 2 - 7-year-olds spent over 20 minutes per day on recreational
        (out of school) use, and 8 - 13-year-olds devoted over an hour per day.
        (And those are averages; some youngsters spend a great deal more time.)
        Finally, the 1999 study found that when asked which of all media they
        would prefer to have with them on a desert island, fully a third of 8-
        through 18-year-olds chose a computer with an Internet connection. No
        other medium - not television, not print, not audio systems, not video
        game systems - garnered even 20% of the nominations. Clearly, today’s
        elementary school youngsters are the leading edge of what can legitimately
        be called the Internet generation.</p>
      <p>Unlike the adults likely to be reading this booklet, most U.S. kids 12
        years and younger do not view the Internet and the World Wide Web as revolutionary
        - or even all that remarkable. For as long as today’s youngsters have
        been aware of such things, what adults label &quot;<i>new</i> communication
        technologies&quot; have always existed. Screens that serve as gateways
        to almost unlimited information and entertainment are just the way the
        world is...and as far as young kids are concerned, the way it has always
        been. For most parents reading this book, of course, the new digital technologies
        are decidedly not &quot;the way it has always been.&quot; To us, the Internet
        and World Wide Web represent something quite new and different - something
        that has the potential to change the way children acquire and think about
        entertainment, information, and education. Just to keep things in perspective,
        however, it’s helpful to remember that television provided most of today’s
        parents with access to entertainment, information, and education in ways
        that were quite different from what had previously been available to,
        if not their parents, certainly their grandparents. Although today’s digital
        technologies differ significantly from the television with which most
        of today’s parents grew up, they continue to raise many of the same issues
        associated with earlier media. </p>
      <p>It is not surprising that children’s access to and fascination with the
        Internet unsettles many parents and educators. Digital technology is changing
        how children deal with messages, enabling them to exercise choice, pose
        questions, and manipulate information more fully and easily than ever
        before. Perhaps most unsettling to parents and educators, these new communication
        technologies continue a long-term historical trend toward a loosening
        of parental control over the information that reaches children. The World
        Wide Web promises fundamental changes in the number, kind, and accessibility
        of messages available to children - offering them virtually unrestricted
        access to almost unlimited messages from boundless sources. It’s a vastly
        different information environment from that faced by children at the beginning
        of the last century, an environment in which parents’ ability to vet the
        information reaching their children has been substantially reduced.</p>
      <p>Communication technologies by their very nature have always changed the
        parent-child information relationship. Each new medium - beginning with
        ancient storytellers and continuing through print, radio, movies and television,
        and now the Internet - has worked to diminish the ability of parents (or
        other caretakers including schools and churches) to control the information
        available to youngsters. Indeed, it is the function of each new medium
        to bring messages from &quot;outside&quot; - to tell stories across time
        and space and provide access to ideas and information different from those
        likely to be filtered through traditional gatekeepers. It is not surprising,
        then, that as each new communication medium has increased children’s access
        to &quot;messages from outside,&quot; it has been greeted by a chorus
        of parental (and other establishment) concerns. For evidence of this,
        consider Plato’s banning of storytellers from his Republic, the bowdlerizing
        of <i>Grimm’s Fairy Tales</i>, 19<sup>th</sup> century attacks on the
        dime western, early 20<sup>th</sup> century denunciations of silent films,
        and more recent congressional hearings on the potential dangers of comic
        books, of television, and of video games. In each instance, the rationale
        was protection of youth from messages not filtered by traditional caretakers.
        And to the extent that the messages from outside were at odds with parental
        beliefs and values, in each instance, such concerns were justified. </p>
      <p><b>Learning from media messages.</b> Parents and caretakers have long
        believed that the messages children encounter - whether in the nursery
        rhymes they hear and sing, the fairy tales they read, the television they
        watch, the computer games they play - influence their developing view
        of the world. And over the past half century, extensive scientific research
        has documented that these beliefs are often well founded. Children do
        learn from the stories they encounter. Literally dozens of studies demonstrate
        that children as young as 2 years can acquire highly complex behaviors
        from as little as a single exposure to a model. Dozens of other studies
        show that when the themes of &quot;stories from outside&quot; are relatively
        consistent over time and/or across media (e.g., that violence is fun;
        that to consume is to be happy; that beauty is synonymous with a slim
        body, and so forth), they influence youngsters’ attitudes and values.
        Moreover, learning occurs regardless of whether that model appears in
        real life or on a television or computer screen, and regardless of whether
        the model is a real human or an animated cartoon figure (or for that matter,
        a written description of a model’s behavior).</p>
      <p>Of course, different children learn different things from the same message,
        depending on needs, interests, abilities, background, and so forth. Thus,
        boys and girls or 6-year-olds and 10-year-olds may take away very different
        &quot;lessons&quot; from a film such as <i>Mulan</i>, a television series
        such as <i>The Weekenders</i>, or various Disney's Blast games. For example,
        to a 3-year-old, Disney's Blast <i>Stickertown Airport</i> is about how
        to control an animated airplane’s movement across the computer screen;
        to a 5-year-old, it can promote number recognition; to a 12-year-old it
        may be just silly or boring. Similarly, <i>Goofy’s Gone Fishing </i>may
        promote number recognition among pre-school children and addition skills
        among 6- and 7-year-olds. Children take what they can and/or will from
        a given message, and different children with different abilities and needs
        can and will take different things. But to the extent that youngsters
        pay attention to a message, it is almost as if they cannot avoid being
        influenced by it - cannot help but learn from it. What is acquired may
        be minimal (e.g., even the 1000<sup>th</sup> hearing of the alphabet slightly
        reinforces that knowledge), even trivial (the same goes for commercial
        jingles), or it may be something totally new and important: (e.g., a verbal
        &quot;four&quot; is the same as 4 which is the same as |||| which is the
        same as 1+1+1+1 <i>or</i> 2+2). But regardless of the content noted by
        any given child, to the extent that kids find messages engaging, interesting,
        involving - to that extent they learn.</p>
      <p><b>Informal learning -- Fun Learning.</b> &quot;Informal learning&quot;
        refers to acquiring knowledge outside the classroom, absent any formal
        school curriculum or intention to teach. Much of what humans - children
        and adults - know about their world, they learn in informal settings:
        visiting with friends, on a family outing, pursuing any of a legion of
        leisure activities from following a hobby, through watching television,
        to surfing the Web. In short, a lot of what we know consists of information
        and skills acquired and/or honed in informal settings while primarily
        engaged in having fun. Indeed, many scholars believe that much of children’s
        most important learning occurs when they connect what is taught in school
        to informal situations, when they apply curriculum-based knowledge in
        non-academic settings. &quot;Fun learning&quot; is important.</p>
      <p>To a parent who was raised with <i>Sesame Street</i>, or who has helped
        a child immersed in playing <i>Carmen San Diego</i>, or who has fielded
        a barrage of questions while escorting a son or daughter through the local
        natural history museum, the idea that fun and learning can go hand in
        hand is hardly surprising. When kids are having fun, they are usually
        engaged. And as any schoolteacher knows, when they are engaged, children
        are particularly likely to learn. This, of course, is the fundamental
        premise underlying the concept of what has recently been labeled &quot;edutainment&quot;
        - learning that occurs while the child is being entertained - fun learning.
        The presumption is that fun, entertaining presentations are engaging,
        therefore, that entertainment can provide an effective means to promote
        learning. And a large body of research evidence supports this position.
        There is simply no longer any question that children do learn all kinds
        of things from the games and stories that engage and entertain them. Why,
        then, do so many parents and educators voice skepticism about entertainment
        media as educational tools?</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, over the centuries the word &quot;entertainment&quot;
        has lost some of its original meaning, which initially included a sense
        of engaging or holding one’s attention. Today entertainment primarily
        refers to amusement in the sense of diversion -- often relatively trivial
        diversion. Entertainment is what we seek when we don’t want to engage
        in more serious activities - activities such as education. Typical entertainment
        fare, it is argued, contains little that objective observers would consider
        of much value. Indeed, many contend that typical entertainment fare contains
        a great deal of precisely what parents do not want their children to learn
        - ethnic and gender stereotypes, violent behavior, materialistic values,
        vulgar language - all manner of empty cognitive calories. It is not surprising,
        then, that many voice skepticism about entertainment media playing an
        educational role - skepticism that mounts the further away from an obvious
        &quot;school-like&quot; curriculum the content moves (&quot;Perhaps <i>Sesame
        Street</i> can teach the alphabet, but what’s this about <i>Mulan</i>
        teaching self-reliance?&quot;).</p>
      <p>It is important to note, however, that the thrust of such criticism shifts
        focus away from the <i>process</i> and toward the <i>content</i> of learning.
        That is, disapproval of &quot;edutainment&quot; seldom questions entertainment
        media’s ability to teach. Rather, it focuses on what is learned. Indeed,
        underlying many critics’ concerns is their perception that entertainment
        media teach &quot;the wrong things&quot; extremely well. An antidote to
        this, of course, is for the producers of entertainment material designed
        for children to think seriously about the kinds of learning they might
        promote, the kinds of content that children and parents would find fun
        and engaging <i>and</i> helpful and beneficial. The people at Disney's
        Blast devote a good deal of time and energy to this issue: How can we
        produce on-line activities that are fun and entertaining for kids, and
        that simultaneously promote the learning of valuable information and skills.</p>
      <p>As effective and important as &quot;fun learning&quot; can be, entertainment
        media can never replace the classroom, nor should they even try. Formal
        education is the job of schools. Much of what today’s children need to
        learn in order to function in contemporary society requires the kind of
        structured curriculum and formal pedagogical practices best provided by
        schools. There are many reasons that entertainment media cannot assume
        this task, but one of the more important is that whether we are talking
        about television, a good novel, a music video, or one of Disney's Blast’s
        interactive games, the audience must <i>want </i>to be exposed. There
        is no mandatory attendance, no roll call, no teacher looking over one’s
        shoulder, no tests and grades. If the material fails to engage a child,
        she will click to the next game, flip to the next channel, or put down
        the storybook and turn to a new activity. Whatever form &quot;edutainment&quot;
        takes, if it is not entertaining, there will be no audience ... hence,
        no informal learning. On the other hand, if the producers of fun learning
        emphasize entertainment values too much, they run the risk of being too
        subtle and having children simply overlook the educational message. As
        a recent publication aimed at edutainment producers states: &quot;The
        challenge is to integrate educational material into an entertaining format
        without losing the intended audience.&quot;</p>
      <p><b>The Disney's Blast approach.</b> How does Disney's Blast meet this
        challenge? </p>
      <p>First, Disney's Blast producers and writers try never to forget that
        children select edutainment content in order to be entertained. Kids visit
        Disney's Blast to have fun. If this need is not met, the audience disappears.
        Fortunately, the Disney library affords one of the most appealing and
        entertaining cast of characters ever assembled. From Mickey to the Little
        Mermaid, from Donald to Dumbo, the denizens of Disney's Blast almost guarantee
        that young children will have fun and be engaged. The producers and writers
        also know that Disney's Blast contains numerous different games and activities,
        and that children frequently move among them. This provides an opportunity
        to vary the degree to which different sites emphasize fun relative to
        learning. Sometimes, for some children, a Disney's Blast site may simply
        be fun! And that is great! Fun, after all, is what they come for. Typically,
        however, the activities, games, puzzles, and stories that make up Disney's
        Blast contain elements that promote learning along with fun. </p>
      <p>Second, Disney's Blast producers and writers work on the principle that
        one of the best ways to promote learning is to invite children to apply
        knowledge and practice skills that have been acquired in more formal settings
        such as school. For example, Disney's Blast’s task is not to teach children
        a mathematical skill such as addition. Rather, it is to create engaging
        activities that encourage kids to practice and apply that particular skill
        in fun, entertaining, and challenging contexts (e.g., to ask them to use
        a skill like addition to figure out how to get through a maze or to win
        some kind of game-based competition). The point is to make addition skills
        part of a game, not part of a lesson. The goal is to encourage children
        to practice and have fun with math without even thinking about it. Edutainment
        is often most effective when children are not even aware that they are,
        in fact, acquiring new information or honing a skill acquired in school.
      </p>
      <p>Third, Disney's Blast producers and writers are guided by the knowledge
        that children differ greatly in their needs, in their abilities, and in
        their ideas about what is entertaining. They know they must produce content
        that attracts and benefits both the 4-year-old for whom the entire concept
        of school and learning is one of the most exciting things imaginable,
        and the 9-year-old who, unfortunately, has learned that anything that
        looks like school should not be considered fun. They know they must produce
        content for children who enjoy the opportunity to practice skills over
        and over again and remain with one game or activity for hours on end,
        as well as for children who move from game to game, site to site, in a
        relatively brief time span. Disney's Blast producers and writers know
        that the opportunity to extend a Disney's Blast activity beyond the computer
        screen to the living room floor or the kitchen table will delight some
        kids, but that others will prefer to stay glued to the keyboard and mouse.
        And they know that while many older children neither need nor want directions
        about how to play a game, some younger visitors need instructions, and
        many of the youngest require the help of parents to navigate a given activity.
        In other words, Disney's Blast producers and writers understand that they
        must meet many different needs in many different ways. Thus, they have
        developed a wide variety of fun and entertaining activities from which
        different children can learn a variety of different things. No one game,
        story, puzzle, or activity is likely to serve all children, but every
        effort has been made to provide something fun and beneficial for every
        child.</p>
      <p>Finally, Disney Online invited a team of experts in child development,
        education, and children’s web site design both to help develop new age
        appropriate fun-learning activities, and to create ways to help parents
        (and children) to navigate through the many rich options Disney's Blast
        offers. This team has classified the different Disney's Blast sites on
        two important dimensions: (1) the age range for which particular sites
        are most appropriate; (2) the general educational category of and specific
        educational skills promoted by each activity. In addition, in this book
        parents can also find further descriptions of the general type of activity
        to be found at each site, listings of the Disney characters showcased
        by each site, and suggestions for off-line activities and things to talk
        about that may help extend the influence of each of the various Disney's
        Blast sites.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the most useful criterion on which Disney's Blast activities
        are sorted is the division between <i>Blast</i> and <i>Mouse House Jr.</i>.
        The activities that make up <i>Mouse House Jr.</i> are particularly appropriate
        for pre-schoolers - children from 3 through 5 or 6 years old. Children
        from 6 through 11 or 12 years are more likely to be engaged by the activities
        grouped under the <i>Blast </i>label. This initial classification is based
        on the kinds of things that children younger and older youngsters view
        as fun, on the kinds of knowledge and skill required of children to engage
        the various activities, and on the kinds of learning outcomes that each
        site promotes. For example, visitors to both <i>Blast</i> and <i>Mouse
        House Jr. </i>sites will likely notice that many activities designed for
        pre-schoolers have a more &quot;school-like&quot; appearance than do those
        produced for older kids. As noted earlier, young children typically do
        not distinguish between school and fun in ways that their older siblings
        might. Indeed, younger children love to think of themselves as ready for
        such &quot;big kid stuff&quot; as school. They embrace games and activities
        that invite them to sort shapes and colors or play with letters and numbers
        in ways that, to older children and adults, might seem quite &quot;educational&quot;
        in their demands. The educational elements in <i>Blast </i>activities,
        on the other hand, are often less obvious. Older kids are more likely
        to engage activities that challenge them to put things they already know
        into use in new ways. For example, in order to solve the mystery in <i>Detective
        in a Jar</i>, older youngsters assume a role that asks them to read, calculate,
        recognize patterns, and most important, use each of these skills in the
        service of thinking and problem-solving. There is very little in this
        site that resembles school work.</p>
      <p>Of course, there is no magic line separating 5-year-olds from 6-year-olds.
        Pre-school children and early grade school children often like the same
        stories, often play the same games. Thus, a few Disney's Blast activities
        fall into both the <i>Blast</i> and <i>Mouse House Jr.</i>. categories.
        In such cases, experience shows that both younger and older youngsters
        enjoy the same site, but take different things from it (e.g., <i>Eeyor’s
        Gloomy Rhymes</i> may encourage a 4-year-old to play with rhymes, while
        to a 7-year-old it may also encourage reading). Indeed, there is no guarantee
        that all <i>Mouse House Jr.</i> activities fit the needs and abilities
        of all pre-school children. Many activities appropriate for a 5-year-old
        might be well beyond the abilities of a 3-year-old; instructions and clues
        that require the relatively advanced reading skills of an 8- or 9-year-old
        may do little more than frustrate a 6-year-old who is still struggling
        to decode individual words. Thus, in addition to the broad age classification
        encapsulated in the <i>Blast</i> and <i>Mouse House Jr.</i>. labels, Disney's
        Blast sites are further categorized on the basis of even narrower age-ranges:
      </p>
      <ul type="SQUARE">
        <ul type="SQUARE">
          <li>Mommy and me: 2 - 4 years; </li>
          <li>Preschool: 4 - 6 years; </li>
          <li>Early Childhood: 6 - 8 years;</li>
          <li>Late Childhood: 8 - 10 years;</li>
          <li>Tweens: 10 - 12 years.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Thus, a parent can go beyond games appropriate for &quot;older children,&quot;
        access activities particularly appropriate for a 5-year-old, or a 7-year-old,
        or a 9-year-old, and be presented with a list of games targeted at each
        age. </p>
      <p>Specialists in education and child development also helped to sort Disney's
        Blast sites into general educational categories, each of which is further
        identified on the basis of the specific learning activities promoted.
        Thus, parents can search for activities designed to promote learning in
        a general educational area (e.g., <i>Word Workshop</i>), and can further
        determine what specific word-related skills are called into play (e.g.,
        letter recognition, vocabulary, reading). Disney's Blast’s general educational
        categories and the specific skills they help to promote include: </p>
      <ul type="SQUARE">
        <ul type="SQUARE">
          <li><i>Word Workshop</i>: the ABCs, letter recognition, and sounds (phonetics)
            for younger children; reading, vocabulary, story comprehension, and
            spelling for older children</li>
          <li><i>MathMagic</i>: counting, number recognition, numerosity (e.g.,
            3 = X X X) for younger children; addition, subtraction, multiplication,
            division, arithmetic functions for older children</li>

      <p><b>Summing up.</b> Most kids will find Disney's Blast to be a blast!
        They will gain from its games, puzzles, stories, and other activities.
        At Disney's Blast they will meet old friends that have long been the mainstay
        of the Disney world, and they will make new friends especially designed
        to accompany them through different parts of this new universe we call
        the Internet. They will be entertained, engaged, and challenged.</p>
      <p>&#9;Disney's Blast is not a school, and does not try to be one. Rather,
        it sees its mission as one of many possible supplements to school-based
        learning. It encourages children to put all different kinds of knowledge
        and skills to use in a wide variety of fun, entertaining contexts. It
        challenges them to test themselves, to figure out new ways in which to
        use what they are learning both in and out of school, in and out of Disney's
        Blast, in and out of the rest of their life. And perhaps most important,
        it invites and encourages children to discover that there should be no
        distinction between learning and fun, that the two go hand in hand. If
        Blast does no more than that, it will have accomplished a great deal.</p>
