          <b>What are digital toys?</b><br>
          Digital toys are electronic gadgets that can be played within Disney's
          Blast. They include Disney character trading cards, action games, animated
          puzzles, robot kits, magical music boxes, and much more! </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;<b>

          To get digital toys, members need to win coins. Winning coins is easy-just
          come to Disney's Blast and play games.</font></p>

          From the main Disney's Blast home page, click on the Super Mega Prize
          Center. Inside there are three separate areas: <br>
          <br>
          1) The lobby where Donald Duck greets you. <br>
          2) The Shop where children can see the available digital toys and exchange
          coins for various items. To select an item, simply click on the item
          or on the &quot;buy&quot; button.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;
          <b>How does my child play with a digital toy?</b><br>
          Members can access any of the digital toys inside the Disney's Blast
          Personal Digital Assistant (PDA). The PDA is locating in the Super Mega 
		  Prize Center lobby, and is also available in the store. In addition to your user
          name, the PDA highlights the number of points currently available. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;
          <b>I see a different name next to my child's user name - what does this
          mean? </b><br>
          To encourage exploration and play, Disney's Blast provides rankings
          - as each member earns more coins, that member is awarded a rank in
          honor of their achievement. The ranking system is as follows (from the
          lowest level to the highest):</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Den
          of the Dwarves Contender<br>

          <b>How do I know what rank my child has achieved?</b><br>
           A child's member rank appears on their PDA, and it will update as the child 
		   accumulates more points and advances ranks.
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;
          <b>Is it possible for my child to lose his/her ranking or coins?</b><br>
          Disney's Blast will never reduce a ranking level or deduct coins from
          any member. These can only be lost due to the following conditions:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;
          Exchange of coins for digital toys<br>
          &middot; Cancellation of membership for the entire account<br>
          &middot; Cancellation of a child's account in Disney's Blast Member
          Services</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;
          <b>What happens if I cancel my child's account in Member Services? </b><br>
          If you cancel any child account, ALL information for that child is deleted
          - this includes all points, coins, and digital prizes. Unfortunately,
          this information cannot be restored.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;
          <b>If I cancel my Disney's Blast membership and decide to come back,
          is it possible to restore my child's ranking, coins, and digital toy
          collection?</b><br>
          If an account is canceled, ALL information for that account is deleted
          - this includes all points, coins, and digital prizes. Unfortunately,
          this information cannot be restored.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; 
          <b>What happens if coins, digital toys, or a ranking disappear in error?</b><br>
          If any member believes an item was lost in error, please <a href="http://apps.disneyblast.go.com/cgi-bin/mail/generic_mail.cgi?template=blast/form.tpl">contact 
          us</a> and provide detailed information about which items were lost, 
          including an explanation of how and when the error was noticed.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; 
          <b>What if my coins or digital prizes disappear?</b><br>
          Because of the way the Internet works, sometimes Disney&#146;s Blast 
          might not be able to form a full connection to the Super Mega Prize 
          Center database. If this happens, it will seem as if the digital prizes 
          or the total number of coins that you have &#147;blank out.&#148; Actually, 
          your digital prizes and your coins are still safe in the Super Mega 
          Prize Center, but are temporarily not visible. In the meantime, continue 
          to enjoy Disney's Blast and rest assured that your coins will reappear 
          once the technical issues are cleared up.<br>
