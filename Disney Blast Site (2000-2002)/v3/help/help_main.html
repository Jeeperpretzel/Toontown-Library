              <br>
              We will never post any personal information online including e-mail
              address. When playing some of the games within Disney's Blast, you
              may post your Member Name in Top Scores of the Games area. If you
              win a sweepstakes or contest, we may post your first name, the first
              initial of your last name and your age, city and state. For more
              info, check out our Privacy Policy located in the footer section

              <font color="#FFFF00">How do I add or remove a family member?</font><br>
              <br>
              Simply select &quot;Parents' Corner&quot; from the home page of
              Disney's Blast, and then go to &quot;Help Center.&quot; From there,
              select &quot;Account Information and Safety Settings.&quot; Add
              or remove a family member is one of the options presented in this
              section. With Disney's Blast, you can add up to 4 additional family
              members to your main account. Don't forget, you'll need to set the
              parental controls for each family member added. <br>
              <br>
              <font color="#FFFF00">What are Parental Controls and why do I need
              them?</font><br>
              <br>
              Parental Controls provide you with the most flexibility in designing
              your child's experience on Disney's Blast. Here you can decide if
              you want your child to participate in multi-player games, communicate
              with others on Disney's Blast with restricted chat (not open chat)
              or send electronic cards to others on the Internet. As some new
              features are added on Disney's Blast, you'll have the option to
              include/exclude them in your child's experience. Please note, if
              you have not updated your Parental Controls, don't worry - the default
              setting provides the strictest controls allowed within Disney's
              Blast.<br>

              do I need Shockwave plug-ins?</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
              <br>
              The Shockwave plug-ins are used to enhance your experience at Disney's
              Blast. Some of the games or activities within Disney's Blast require
              the plug-ins to be downloaded first in order to start the program.
              And without these programs we could not bring you all the fun and
              excitement you expect from Disney.<br>
              <br>
              <font color="#FFFF00">Where can I download the Shockwave plug-ins?</font><br>
              <br>
              When you reach a game or activity that requires the Shockwave plug-in,
              you will be prompted to download the plug-in at that time. You can
              also download the plug-in in advance at the software center for
              Disney's Blast. You can find the software center within Parent's
              Corner and/or at the Disney's Blast log-in page.<br>
              <br>
              <font color="#FFFF00">Why can't I download the Shockwave plug-ins?</font><br>
              <br>
              One reason for this problem might be the browser you are using.

              <br>
              The Disney's Blast Parent's Corner is an area within Disney's Blast
              designed just for Parents. It provides information on the color-coding
              used to highlight the age-appropriateness of the games, stories
              and activities. It provides information on the various learning
              categories and a Fun Finder to allow you to quickly search for the
              most appropriate content for your child based on age, learning category
              or their favorite Disney character. The Parents' Corner is also
              the area within Disney's Blast to update and or change your individual
              account information. <br>

              <br>
              You can get to the Parents' Corner at anytime within Disney's Blast
              by either clicking on the wooden sign on the bottom right hand corner
              in the Disney's Blast home page, which says &quot;Parents' Corner&quot;,
              clicking on the Parents' Corner icon on the upper right hand corner
              of Blast Dome home page, or by clicking on the Parents' Corner icon

              <font color="#FFFF00">What does color coding mean?</font><br>
              <br>
              Color coding is an easy way to locate the games, activities and
              stories that are right for your child. Each color represents a different
              age group-yellow for ages 3-6, blue for ages 6-8 and red for 8-10.<br>
              <br>
              <font color="#FFFF00">What does educational category mean?</font><br>
              <br>
              All the content in Disney's Blast was sorted into general categories,
              each of which describes the particular learning skill being promoted.
              Learning skills such as Brainbusters, Listening, Word Workshop,
              Mathmagic, and Creativity Corner, will help you choose the most
              appropriate activity for your child. Check out the Fun Finder for
              more information on how to use these categories.<br>
              <font color="#FFFF00"><br>
              What is the Fun Finder and how can it help me?</font><br>
              <br>
              Fun Finder allows you to discover new Disney's Blast games and activities
              by age, category and character name. Fun Finder is located in the
              Blast Parents' Corner. Simply select the child's age, the educational
              category or favorite Disney character and click on &quot;Find&quot;
              and the first 10 items that fit your criteria will be listed on
              the upper right hand side of the Find Finder. You can access any
              one of the items listed by simply clicking on the item you want.
